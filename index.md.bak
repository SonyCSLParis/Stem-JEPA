# Stem-JEPA - Supplementary material

This repository describes the additional material and experiments around the paper "Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Musical Stem Compatibility Estimation", submitted to ISMIR 2024.

**Abstract:**

Assessing the compatibility of musical stems within a specific audio context is essential for tasks like retrieval and accompaniment generation. Our paper investigates the automated process of determining stem compatibility, which involves identifying music recordings that sound good together when mixed. To address this, we introduce Stem-JEPA, a new Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) trained on a multi-track dataset through a self-supervised approach.
Our model comprises two networks (an encoder and a predictor) that are jointly trained to learn semantic representations from an input mix and predict the representations of another stem from the same track that was not included in the initial mix. Training a model in such a way allows its use in the estimation of stem compatibility (predicting a stem that will sound good with a mix) or downstream tasks (such as genre or key estimation) because the training paradigm forces the model to learn information related to timbre, harmony or rhythm.
We evaluate our model’s performance on a retrieval task on the MUSDB18 dataset, testing its ability to find the missing stem from a mix. We also show that the learned embeddings capture temporal alignment information and, finally, evaluate the representations learned by our model on several downstream tasks, highlighting that they effectively capture meaningful musical features.

## Retrieval performances: Audio examples

Here we investigate the retrieval performances of our model using one global embedding for each whole stem/mix, as described in section 5.1 of the paper. We focus on 2 different audio examples.

- For all stems but drums, the ground truth is among the 3 closest embedding from the prediction.
- For bass and drums, the closest embedding is the "other" stem of the same track.
- For vocals, the retrieved stems have similarities with the ground truth (female voice with a lot of reverb, choirs, long notes)
- For drums, none of the closest embeddings are actually drums but the two first ones are the "other" and "vocals" embeddings of the same track. This is a typical failure case of our model, as shown in figure 2 of the paper.

In this example, retrieval performances are perfect for all tracks. For both bass and drums, the second match is also a relevant stem with the same kind of groove, while the third is another stem from the track. For the "other" stem, the second nearest neighbor is the drum stem and the third is a similar one.


## Stem alignment analysis

Here we observe how the similarity between the representations of a stem and the predictions of the same stem from the rest of the mix evolves when applying a time-shift between them (see section 5.2 of the paper).

This figure reveals interesting patterns:

- The similarity is almost always a maximum when the shift is zero, then it decreases. However, for any shift it remains (usually significantly) higher than the mean for different representations/projections, which reveals that representations capture both global and local information.
- Moreover there are pseudo-periodic patterns for all curves, highlighting the presence of rhythmic information in our representations.
- Track 1 has a high tempo and the track evolves over time, hence a clear decay and a small pseudo-period. On the other hand, tracks 4 and 13 keep almost the same loop over the song, leading to almost no decay.
- For tracks 10 and 11, the maximal cosine similarity is obtained for a shift of -8 and 11 seconds respectively, which roughly corresponds to a cycle of 4 measures in these tracks.
